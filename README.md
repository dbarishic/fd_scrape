## warning: horrible rushed code :(

# Just run docker-compose up

it will build two docker containers:
* postgresql db
* python script

The scripts crawls the given page, saves crawled data to db,
reads same data and plots events by day

#### Note: Code as first submitted is tagged with v0.0.1, if/when I change/refactor/improve the code I will add a new tag
